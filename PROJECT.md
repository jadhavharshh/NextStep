## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (TypeScript)
- **Backend:** Express.js (TypeScript)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Dockerized setup)
- **AI Service:** Python-based recommendation engine
- **External APIs:** Government & NGO APIs for college and scholarship data
- **Content Integration:** Open Educational Resources for study material

## System Architecture

The system is designed to be modular and scalable, ensuring smooth communication between different components. The workflow can be described as follows:

1. **User Interaction**: Students interact with the platform through the frontend, built with Next.js and TypeScript. They can take quizzes, explore courses, check colleges, and receive notifications.
2. **Frontend Layer**: The frontend sends API requests to the backend whenever a user performs an action such as submitting quiz answers or searching for colleges.
3. **Backend Layer**: The backend, built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript, acts as the central processing hub. It handles incoming requests, applies business logic, and interacts with other services.
4. **Database**: A PostgreSQL database (running in Docker) stores user profiles, quiz data, course mappings, college information, and timelines.
5. **AI Service**: A Python-based microservice processes quiz results and provides personalized recommendations for courses, colleges, and career paths.
6. **Government & NGO APIs**: The backend integrates with external APIs to fetch updated information about government colleges, eligibility criteria, scholarships, and admission timelines.
7. **Open Educational Content**: The system links to free, open educational resources that support students with relevant study material and skill-building resources.

## Expected Impact

1. **Improved Enrollment**: More students opting for government degree colleges.
2. **Reduced Dropouts**: Better career guidance leading to informed decisions.
3. **Empowered Students**: Access to reliable career pathways.
4. **Positive Image of Government Colleges**: Highlighting opportunities and success stories.
